# HiFi

### **Vision statement**(more imformation on posts)
HiFi will be used to browse and purchase the latest electronics and computer parts with the best deals. Similar to other electronics stores, HiFi will list hundreds of products that can be purchased on a user’s smartphone at any time. HiFi will hold data about all products and different technical specifications for each.

HiFi is designed for tech savy customers looking to buy new electronics. It will permit customers to view the electronic devices with the option of selecting a device from a particular category and/or price range. Customers would be able to view the history of their previous purchases, they would also be able to return any product or cancel any transaction in the case of any problems with any previous transactions. In addition, customers would be able to add any needed product to their shopping cart or wish list. After purchase, customers would be able to provide reviews about their products or rate their products for the benefit of future potential customers. To ensure the credibility of reviews, we will ensure that only the customers who purchased a product will be able to provide reviews or rate a product that they purchased. Customers will also have a “buy again” option for an already purchased product if they are interested.

Different levels of security will be required for each possible use of the system. For example, customers who have not added credit or debit cards or provided any payment plan will not be allowed to actually purchase any product, but they will still have access to the product list, and they will be able to see the details and prices of the products. Administration would have the ability to access any product, modify the price of the selected product and set any product to be “out of stock” as required. 

HiFi is envisioned as an application in the Android system, but it will be extensible so that future releases can be accessed in IOS systems, Linux systems and even have a web-based interface so that more people can be exposed to the store and have the option of buying any electronic device from the store at any time anywhere.

HiFi will be a specific online store for electronic devices, we will provide a convenient search system and shopping system for everyone. As a result, customers would be able to save time and expense on purchasing electronic devices, they would be able to access any information they need about electronic devices easily. Since the software will be developed in-house, the maintenance costs will be lower than the annual license fees for a common online shop, and because the system will be designed for the majority of people so it will not require expensive customization.
