# Vision Statement

The **Nile Bookstore** will be an e-commerce platform that offers a wide range of academic materials including textbooks, course materials, merchandise, and other resources useful to university residents. **Nile** will be accessible to all students and faculty members of universities - providing a seamless and convenient way to purchase and access the materials they need for their studies.

The **Nile Bookstore** is mainly designed for university students, as they have the greatest need for the items provided. Secondary would be the university staff/faculty who also have the need as well, albeit with a much smaller population than the students. Given the nature of academia, the user population should always remain constant as the need for course material in university never disappears, ensuring **Nile** with new and repeat users every year.

Our scope of this project is to implement a user-friendly and easy-to-navigate interface that allows users to search, filter, and buy the materials they need. Users will be able register and login to their accounts. Items can be viewed by category, including by price, alphabetically, and condition. Users can also view and modify their shopping cart along with an estimate of how much their total order will cost. They can proceed to choose how they want to receive their items aswell as what payment information to use.

Overall, **Nile** will be a valuable resource for students and faculty, providing them with the materials they need to succeed in their studies while also streamlining the purchasing process. The option for the user to save payment methods, or to save a delivery location will be implemented, making the purchasing process quick and easy. With each purchase, a verification will be shown to the user with the details of purchase to aid them in case of incidents where delivery process has failed or if needing a refund.

Since **Nile** will be used one-way only - for selling books - it does not need to consider any external seller or manufacturer information. **Nile** will be used by users exclusively to buy. However, it will need to keep track of user accounts, stock, and item information.

The **Nile Bookstore** is envisioned to be an android application with the goal of being easily accessible and simple to use, similar to how the Nile River benefited society in the early ages and well into the modern era.

The structure of our bookstore will be an improvement over current systems because of its simplicity. More complicated applications are unappealing to first-time users. **Nile** will be simple to navigate so even first-time users can quickly purchase an item. As a result, **Nile** will have more reoccurring users as their first experience was a welcoming one. Like the simplicity of the design, it should also be easy to create - keeping the cost of maintenance at a minimum. **Nile** will work with university faculty, staff, and students to gather feedback and improve the platform over time.

The main goal of this project is to create an online bookstore that is tailored to the specific needs of the academic community, providing an easier and more efficient way for students and faculty to purchase and access the materials they need for their studies. We can consider the project a success if the overall bookstore - through **Nile** with University of Manitoba students and staff - results in a $5000 revenue for the 2023 Fall semeseter aswell as satisfactory student and staff ratings through surveys.
