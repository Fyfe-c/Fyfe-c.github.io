## Postive Outcomes From Development

From working on the Nile Book Store, we have been able to develop good job designation. When deciding what each member of the team could do. We made it so that if possible their next task was related to their first, making it easier to complete said job. 
Team meetings were always useful as we were able to keep track of what has been done and what needs to be done, making the process run much smoother. 
After the early stage of development when one would need to utilize another members work, communication proved to be efficient in making the new features.

## Negative Outcomes From Development

As with every production, nothing does perfectly, there are always hiicups along the way.
At the start the team encountered problems with organization, with details being forgotten because of lack of going overeverything.
The team as well hit a problem when a team member left the project with little notice. These problems have all been addressed throughout production and
now the team manages there time and work load much better then they began.

## Questions

#### How did the Project from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted

We kept the same vision up until near the end. We had no need to change our vision until we saw the final look. We realized that the flow of pages was a little to complicated so we opted for combining them to make it much easier for the user to use. Example being making our home page include search and item display.

#### What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?

Throughout the production we learned alot about testing our devices, using unit, integration, and system tests. 
The way we structured the team meeting became much for efficient/effective near the end, so our learning there was beneficial. 
Good team organization goes a long way when it comes to these projects, designating someone to handling the organization will 
allow for good team cooperation. In the event of the next project, we would keep doing all of the above as they have been very helpful for 
completing the project. Only thing to suggest to start doing would be creating a stronger founation where the features and developer tasks are 
more solid and relaistic/refined. This will make the process simpler as we will be less confused on what each iteam is refering too. 

#### Can you draw any conclusions from what you've done?
 
Conclusions we have come to would be, always assume that a members work will be done, but keep communication up for them to inform on any issues that occur. 
This means that you should just check up with your team members to see how their progress is going. Can also conclude that team meetings promote great communication with the team, having more meetings that 
are short is better then less meetings that are long. When working as a team is best to play to each individuals strength, this allowed us to make a beautiful app. 

#### Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant deisgn decisions?

A brilliant design decision would eb combining the home page with the serach and item display. This made the app look much simpler, what we were going for and solved some bugs in our code.
Another idea was adding in the logo to our loading screen at the begining of our app. Made it look really good and was liked by all members.

#### What took the most time? The least? Any surprises? 

Out of all the tasks we did, setting up the SQL database in iteration 2 took the most amount of time. We did predict this would take time so it was accounted for, but we still should have included more time for it.
The least amount of time would be setting up the search filters. After creating the first one, they went by fairly quickly. A surprise would 
be the amount of time it took for the "beautifying" at the end. A team member went above and beyond making the flow/appearance amazing.

#### What went wrong in the development process?

The problems we had was due to lack of organization and communication early in development. This involved in missing details until the end of permitted 
time. This problem was fixed by the third iteration. Lack of communication when came to completing tasks. This was solved by creating weekly meetings allowing us to keep
 up with everyones progress. Our time predictions were very off at the beginning, which definitely confused us for planning as well. Having weeks with too much or too little work. This would need to be improved for any later projects.
