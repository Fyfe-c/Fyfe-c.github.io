# Are there any design smells, or brilliant design decisions?

The database took the most time, using SQL had some prbles getting to work with every thing we needed and there was a learning curve with implementing in Android studio.
The buy again feature and the wishlist took some of the least time because we were able to use other parts of the project that lead really easly into these features. writeing the test was a bit suprise because of the "learning" curve, but once figured it was suprisingly.


# How did your project change from your initial vision or storie, or did it all work out as predicted?
The project worked out pretty similar to our initial vision, we belive this is the case because we did it have to scrop any of our ideas, and we choose very affainable made for learing and writing the tests of the project cae together as we had visioned it to.
